## 🔍 Key Insights
- The **25–34 age group** generated the highest conversion volume at the lowest cost per conversion.
- Certain campaigns incurred **high ad spend with low approved conversions**, negatively impacting ROI.
- High click volume does not always translate into high-quality conversions, highlighting the importance of conversion efficiency over raw engagement.

---

## 📌 Actionable Recommendations
- Increase budget allocation toward high-performing age groups, particularly 25–34.
- Optimize or pause campaigns with low approved conversion rates and high spend.
- Focus on ads driving quality, approved conversions rather than clicks alone.
- Continuously monitor conversion efficiency metrics to guide weekly campaign optimization.
